# Large Langauge Models Q&A with citations

Software components: Large Language Models, OpenAI, Langchain, Django. 

This demo is build to preset the current possibilities of Large Langauge Models (LLMs). At the moment, 13 PDFs documents of my JRC technical reports are indexed in the database.
A user can ask questions, and the LLMs will give an answer based on these documents with citations. If the user ask question that is out of the domain, the LLMs will reply that it do not have enough information.

## Example questions:

- What is AI?
- What is interoperability?
- How is interoperability related to AI?
- What is medicine?

*be patient with the response because it is on the cheapest possible VM (virtual machine) 

*every prompt is paid so please use with care.
