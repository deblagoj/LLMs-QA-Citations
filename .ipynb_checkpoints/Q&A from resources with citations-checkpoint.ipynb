      "Question: Importance of interoperability of Citizen Science data and metadata?\n",
      "\n",
      "Interoperability of Citizen Science data and metadata is crucial for the success of Citizen Science projects. Standards for Citizen Science data and metadata are needed to ensure interoperability, and various organizations are working towards this goal (Schade2020 pages 3-3). The development of interoperability of Citizen Science data is divided into three areas: data about Citizen Science projects and activities, data about Citizen Science data sets, and observations and measurements from Citizen Science. Challenges may arise when bringing already existing data sources together, but re-usable and interoperable components can be designed (Schade2020 pages 18-18). Interoperability is also important in addressing issues of data donation, data sovereignty, and the people-dimension of data ecosystems. Citizen Science theory and practice have evolved strongly over the past half-decade, leading to considerable changes and recognition in policy. It is time to take the next steps and systematically improve the embedding of Citizen Science into the larger context of citizen engagement and new forms of governance (Schade2020 pages 42-42).\n",

      "Question: What is AI?\n",
      "\n",
      "AI, or artificial intelligence, is an interdisciplinary field that deals with models and systems for the performance of functions generally associated with human intelligence, such as reasoning and learning (Samoili3087). AI research is defined as the study of \"intelligent agents\": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions to achieve its goals, including pattern recognition and the application of machine learning and related techniques (Samoili3087). AI is the whole idea and concepts of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that mimics human intelligence and would be considered \"smart\" (Samoili3087). AI is defined as machine intelligence or intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans (Delipetrev3022). The term AI is often used to describe machines that mimic human cognitive functions such as learning, understanding, reasoning, or problem-solving (Delipetrev3022). AI has two main dimensions, as shown in Table 2 below. The AI definitions on top of the table relate to processes and reasoning, whereas the ones at the bottom side address behavior (Delipetrev3022). AI is currently used in many applications, including medical diagnostics and robotics (Craglia2942). However, the text also highlights the potential shortcomings of AI, including inheriting imperfections from humans and the need for transparent and reliable systems (Craglia2942).\n",

      "Question: Was there an AI winter?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, there were two AI winters. The first AI winter started in the 1970s due to unfulfilled promises, vast expectations, and financial difficulties. The limitations of computing power, memory, and processing speed also contributed to the AI winter (Delipetrev3022 pages 10-11). The second AI winter occurred after the 1990s when the term \"expert system\" dropped from the IT lexicon, and it was referred to as the second AI winter. One of the main problems in expert systems was knowledge acquisition. However, while funding dried up, and researchers avoided the term AI, many of them continued working under other discipline-specific names: cognitive systems, intelligent systems, knowledge representation, and reasoning (Delipetrev3022 pages 12-14).\n",
